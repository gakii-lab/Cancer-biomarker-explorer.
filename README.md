# 🧬 Cancer Biomarker Explorer

**Cancer Biomarker Explorer** is an open-source resource that organizes and contextualizes diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers relevant to cancer research and academic pathology. Designed for researchers, students, and educators, this repository bridges molecular pathology with translational oncology by integrating biomarker profiles, testing methodologies, and clinical relevance across cancer types.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Support academic learning in histopathology, cytology, and cancer biology  
- Provide quick reference for biomarker selection, expression patterns, and testing methods  
- Facilitate translational research by linking biomarkers to targeted therapies  
- Promote open sharing of annotated case studies, images, and literature summaries
